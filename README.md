AI-Driven Analysis of Neurological Disorder Data Using KBase and HPC Resources at Brookhaven National Lab.
By: Omer Latif

The Idea:
This project explores the integration of AI and systems biological tools to analyze publicly available biological data related to neurological disorders. Using minimal-code platforms such as KBase, combined with ML frameworks (or Heuristics) running on NVIDIA H100 HPC nodes at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL), we aim to identify key gene expression patterns and molecular networks associated with conditions such as epilepsy. Data will be sourced from repositories like GEO or GTEx, and preprocessed using bioinformatics workflows. This approach allows for low-code AI model development while leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) resources for analysis, classification, and visualization. The result is a streamlined, accessible pipeline for biological discovery in computational neuroscience.

Background:
Neurological disorders such as epilepsy and Alzheimer’s involve complex disruptions to genetic and molecular systems. Advances in transcriptomics and proteomics have generated rich datasets capturing these disruptions, but interpreting them requires computational approaches. Traditional bioinformatics workflows can be inaccessible due to coding barriers. This project links the gap by using platforms like KBase, which offers systems biology modeling through GUI workflows, alongside AI/ML tools to derive biological meaning from neurological data. By training and deploying models on BNL’s NVIDIA H100 HPC nodes (or 12 4xA100-SXM4), this project emphasized speed, accessibility, and scalability in computational neuroscience.
Due to KBase's policy restrictions regarding direct human data, this project will rely on model organisms—non-human species studied extensively to provide insights into human biology. These organisms, including Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), are foundational to biomedical research due to their genetic and physiological similarities to humans. Their use has enabled critical discoveries in genetics, neuroscience, and drug development. In this project, model organism datasets will be used to simulate neurological conditions and understand gene expression patterns relevant to human disorders, ensuring both ethical compliance and translational relevance.

Question?
Can low-code AI/ML tools integrated with KBase and HPC systems identify gene expression patterns or molecular networks associated with neurological disorders?

Objectives:
Collect transcriptomic or omics datasets for a selected neurological disorder.
Use KBase and public tools to preprocess and model data. (e.g., Build gene or metabolic allotropes).
Train simple ML models (e.g., clustering or classification) on BNL’s HPC nodes.
Visualize significant genes or pathways and compare them with literature findings.
Propose a reproducible, minimal-code pipeline for computational biology research.
